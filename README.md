# Machine Learning Experiment
This is an attempt to make a machine learning algorithim to use in a later to chose dataset
## Neural network class
the neural network class will be based on the one I created for the repositorie neural_network_experiment for the use of networks improved by natural selection to solve the flappy bird game
## Objective
MAke predictions on a yet to choose dataset
## Limitations
As this is all made with python and with very little optimization yet it would be difficult to train large networks
